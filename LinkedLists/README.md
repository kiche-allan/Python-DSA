Linked List is a data structure whee the data elements are stored in a linear order. Linked list provides efficient strorage of data in linear data through pointer structures. Pointers are used to store the memory address of data item. They store the data and location, and the location stores the next position of the next data item in memory.
A linked list is an organization where each item in the list is a seperate node
Each link is is attached to the next link by a reference that points to the next links in a linked list, each link is in the chain is called a node
The data elements stored in memory in different locations that are connected through pointers. A pointer is an object that can store the memory address of a variable, and each data elements points to the next data element and so on until the last element, which points to None
The length of the list can increase or decrease during the execution of the program.


Nodes and Pointer

A node is a key component of several data structures such a linked lists. A node is a container of data, together with one or more links to other nodes where a link is a pointer

We need to learn the following operations in order to use any linked lists in
real-time applications.
Traversing the list
Inserting a data item in the list:
Inserting a new data item (node) at the beginning
Inserting a new data item (node) at the end of the list
Inserting a new data item (node) in the middle/or at any given
position in the list
Deleting an item from the list:
Deleting the first node
Deleting the last node
Deleting a node in the middle/or at any given position in the list
